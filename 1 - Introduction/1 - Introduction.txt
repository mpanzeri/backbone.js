What is backbone js:
-------------------

Backbone.js is a framework that allows you to structure your Javascript code in a MVC (Model, View, Controller) 

Dependencies that you need to use:
-------------------------------

1) Jquery
2) Backbone
3) Underscore

Installation / configuration:
----------------------------

As you can see in the "index.html", you have to import these 3 js files. (underscore.js, jquery,js, backbone.js)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
    </head>
        <body>
            <script src="js/underscore.js"></script>
            <script src="js/jquery.js"> </script>
            <script src="js/backbone.js"></script>
        </body>
</html>

If installation is proper...
----------------------------

Open your index.html file in chrome and open chrome developer tools and open console tab, if you type "Backbone" you should have access for global BackBone variables
